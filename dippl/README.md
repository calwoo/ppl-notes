### Notes on "The design and implementation of probabilistic programming languages"

Reading through `N. D. Goodman and A. Stuhlm√ºller (electronic). The Design and Implementation of Probabilistic Programming Languages.`

Since they use WebPPL, but I don't particularly enjoy JS, I'm just gonna try to read it in Python. And hopefully later on in a significantly better PL than either of these.

#### organization

A (really) tiny PPL prototype will be written in the `pyppl` directory. Everything else is just dumped here.
